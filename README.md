# The Luna AI Project
This repository is both a personal project and my master's degree thesis. <br>
The repository's original purpose is to be a journey of creation, the creation being an AI capable of human-like conversations (something like Chat-GPT, YOU, Character.AI...)<br>


## Ideas: 
- Core: The main functionalities, where the model is trained and stored at. 
- Personality/behaviour: The 'customization' part of the AI where it can also choose for itself it's own personality and way of acting and thinking.
- Database/information storage area: The storage of informations part where both the programmer and A.I can store information regarding diverse subjects including the conversations themselves.
- Processing unit: Takes into account the information stored, the personality and behaviour it currently has, uses the core to process. Acting as a CPU.
- User interface: Whatever the Processing unit comes up with, it is transmited to the UI and then output for the user.
