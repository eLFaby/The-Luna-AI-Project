# The Luna AI Project
This repository is both a personal project and my master's degree thesis. <br>
The repository's original purpose is to be a journey of creation, the creation being an AI capable of human-like conversations (something like Chat-GPT, YOU, Character.AI...)<br>


## Ideas: 
- Core: The main functionalities, where the model is trained and stored at. 
- Personality/behaviour: The 'customization' part of the AI where it can also choose for itself it's own personality and way of acting and thinking.
- Database/information storage area: The storage of informations part where both the programmer and A.I can store information regarding diverse subjects including the conversations themselves.
- Processing unit: Takes into account the information stored, the personality and behaviour it currently has, uses the core to process. Acting as a CPU.
- User interface: Whatever the Processing unit comes up with, it is transmited to the UI and then output for the user.


  ## <p><b>Names:</b></p>
- Core: Luna
- Personality: Europa
- Database: Callisto
- Consciousness: Titan
- Void: Luna-2




The Core and Void serve as the Body and Mind of the A.I, or as the Yin and Yang. The dynamic could bring balance to the whole system, or destroy it (*insert star wars joke here*)
